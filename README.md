# Building and running a basic application on Creator Ci40 OpenWrt

#### For more details about the platform please visit [Creator (Ci40) Marduk](https://community.imgtec.com/platforms/creator-ci40/)
----

## Overview

led_flash is a basic C application written for OpenWrt on Creator Ci40, its purpose is both to provide a very simple application that will show the board and OpenWrt are working, as well as providing a skeleton reference environment to build and run a C application on the board. When led_flash is run it will flash the HEARTBEAT LED on and off 10 times.

## Build Instructions

1) This project is built on the PC that was used to build openwrt for Ci40 (to build OpenWrt, see the README in the OpenWrt repository [here](https://github.com/FlowM2M/openwrt/blob/master-pistachio/README)). The process of building software using a PC environment that is targetted to run on the Ci40 is known as cross compiling. The cross compiling environment is automatically created when you build OpenWrt for Ci40 from source code.

2) From the root of the build environment use the existing package directory

	$ cd package

3) Create a subdirectory for your project â€“ led_flash in this case

	$ mkdir led_flash

4) Within led_flash create a src directory

	$ cd led_flash

	$ mkdir src

5) Place the led_flash OpenWrt Makefile in the led_flash directory

6) Place the led_flash.c source and the standard c makefile into the src directory

7) Return to the build root directory

8) Add the led_flash package to the feeds

	$ ./scripts/feeds install led_flash

9) Select the led_flash package in the menuconfig

	$ make menuconfig


Enter the Utilities section and select the led_flash option
Save the config to the default .config filename and exit menuconfig

10) Build the led_flash application

	$ make package/led_flash/compile


The led_flash binary is now available in 

> build_dir/target-mipsel_mips32_musl-1.1.11/led_flash

11) Copy the led_flash binary to the openWrt ci40 environment. SCP is used to perform the copy in this example but many other methods are available to copy the file

* Ensure your Ci40 is running OpenWrt and that you have a command line terminal open

* Connect the Ci40 to an ethernet cable on the same domain as your build machine

* Use the ifconfig command in OpenWrt to view the IP address of your Ci40 board

		$ ifconfig


* The IP address is the inet value of the eth0 section of the displayed data

>          eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr CE:6A:10:55:72:9D

>                    inet addr:10.40.5.25  Bcast:10.40.5.255  Mask:255.255.255.0


* In this example the IP address is 10.40.5.25

* On the build machine use the linux tool scp to copy the led_flash application to the Ci40 OpenWrt environment

		$ scp led_flash root@10.40.5.25:led_flash


If prompted to accept SSH keys to the Ci40 board answer "yes"
	
12) The led_flash application is now ready to run on your Ci40 OpenWrt environment

	$ ./led_flash
